    <p>Well I kind of lied, this isnt really about c418 so much as it is about art in general. I've been coding again for the first time in years and am remembering how much fun i had doing it. It's a creative medium like any other and it's kind of made me think about art again. <br> <br>I havent really made art in a really long time. I've been depressed, dysfunctional, and above all i've been working. I can't remember the last time i made something i actaully really liked. Until now really. I had to brush up on my coding skills before applying to a software engineering program. And so that paired with the fact that i've been playing more video games has just renewed my interest in creation. <br><br>I was listening to c418's minecraft volume alpha and holy god is it one of the best albums. The cleverness of it is that its managed to cleave itself to the game. I cannot separate the game from its music--they are one and the same to me. And I want to be able to do that. <br><br>I want to create art that evokes that feeling. I want to be able to make a piece of art that incorporates multiple mediums that play off one another. I guess I've always felt like i had a master of none approach to art, but I don't want to frame it like that. I want to create something using all of the things I know already, even if my skills arent as deep as i want them to be. I just want to create something beautiful.</p>
