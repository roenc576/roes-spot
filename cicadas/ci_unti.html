  <h3>Untitled No. 2</h3>
  <p>
      , hearts hooked, tucked in the ripple of a blanket,<br>
      rest distended, sour, floating, bring us back a morning, <br>
      a glass eye suspended in sleep, the memory of my neck <br>
      hollowed in yours, 

  </p>
  <h3>Untitled No. 1</h3>
  <p>
      Rinse my tomb with feathers left over from when<br>
      An angel un-angeled.<br>
      Whet my tongue on the pumice stone you found when <br>
      child-you reached into the mouth of a volcano. <br>
      Reach into its cavity and see if thereâ€™s still a smile.
