  <h3>What Has Wings and Six Legs</h3>
  <p>
butterflies make       pretty bees make       sweet mosquitoes<br> 
make you scratch       in the middle       of the night       flies fly quick<br>     buzz around ears       roaches scrawl       in the dark and trash<br>       fireflies glow       in your hands       good for jars       cicadas chant<br>       one love song       before sleep       and dragonflies       they sing<br>       for no one       through the pond
