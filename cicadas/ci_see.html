  <h3>See, Even the Gods Get Peckish</h3>
  <p>
        sun not as an eye,<br> 
    but as a mouth<br>
    that retches into<br>
    our vision; 

  </p>
  <p>
        or a throat that hums<br>
    as we burn away-- <br>
    heart, lungs, liver.<br>

  </p>
  <p>
        it was the age of the dying,<br>
    the sun was an animal<br>
    of choices,<br>

  </p>
  <p>
        and Helios <br>
    unsung <br>
    craved pralines.
