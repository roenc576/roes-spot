  <h3>Gilgamesh and Enkidu Went to Heaven Holding Hands</h3>
  <p>
      every time we die we look back<br> 
gilgamesh and enkidu went to heaven holding hands<br> 
we asked them to rescue us too<br> 
gilgamesh and enkidu went to heaven holding hands<br> 
to rewrite history <br> 
gilgamesh and enkidu went to heaven holding hands<br> 
so love was shed here <br> 
gilgamesh and enkidu went to heaven holding hands<br> 
with a wet axe we embraced like a wife<br> 
gilgamesh and enkidu went to heaven holding hands<br> 
and the carrion birds picked you<br> 
gilgamesh and enkidu went to heaven holding hands<br> 
in the seam of your belly <br> 
gilgamesh and enkidu went to heaven holding hands<br> 
that smiled at the sun <br> 
gilgamesh and enkidu went to heaven holding hands<br> 
“I read it in a book,” God said<br> 
gilgamesh and enkidu went to heaven holding hands<br> 
“many times but it still bears repeating”<br> 
gilgamesh and enkidu went to heaven holding hands<br>
