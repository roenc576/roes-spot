  <h3>Self-portrait as Disappearing Act</h3>
  <p>
    In order to get good at this you have to earn it—you have to disappear. This is what your<br>English teacher says. Before you disappear, you need to know your own reflection. This<br> is what I say. In the apartment you grew up in your mirrors were raised without a face,<br> and the first time you see mine you mistake it for yours.<br><br>

In order to get good at this you work for words that don’t exist because you are tired and<br> think that non-existence will save you. But every word that has been said was erected<br> on silence. 
You&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;instead.<br><br>

In order to get good at this you learn that you have to choose which silence to listen to.<br> And that “which” always means “whose.” In order to get good at this you separate your<br> silence from your mother’s silence from your father’s silence from your mother’s<br> mother’s and wonder if silence has memory.<br><br>

In order to get good at this you teach your blood to run counter-clockwise and wind up<br> wounds in case you need to play them back for people on a dime. Sometimes your<br> blood spills like a newborn and sometimes it spills like ink. You cry every time.<br><br>

In order to get good at this you try to hold a girl<br> 
still but she’s too heavy for your poems.
