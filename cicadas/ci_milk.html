  <h3>Milk Teeth</h3>
  <p>
    i was five years old when i turned;<br>
pleasant as a strawberry covered in wax,<br> 
i dripped; away from my heart;<br> 
lept into the arms of the one person who had<br>
found peace; it was an old woman with a<br> 
claw holding a claw holding a hand towel;<br> 
i asked what she was planning as her arms<br> 
girded me; a weight so heavy i could<br>
cradle the earth's core;<br> 
  </p>
