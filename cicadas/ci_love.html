  <h3>Love Letters</h3>
  <p>
      Plum trees forgetting to line our street,<br>
remembering this morning was the best<br><br>

night we will ever have. The moon breathing<br>
on my doorstep; your wobbly knees knocking out <br><br>

a crater’s lip, asking it to recite a name no one had ever<br>
spoken. The moon, half-face, all ass, all eyes,<br><br>

looking for the name inside of a condom<br>
choking on a puddle of cherry-scented nail-polish<br><br>

& moss drained from our hips, nodding—<span><em>Yes</em></span>. <br>
You: <span><em>Yes isn’t a name</em></span>.<br><br>

& me: <span><em>And even if it was, it’s one we’ve heard</em></span>.<br>
before us there is no moon spanked into the sky,<br><br>

just a blade of gas, a keychain of letters<br><br>

signed <span><em>xoxo</em></span>.
