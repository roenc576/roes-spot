  <h3>Summer of 1999999 B.C.</h3>
  <p>
      turn of the millenium: sky breaks<br> 
      husk of day, cicadas chant<br>
      one love song before sleep, good lord <br>
      says <span><em>i’m playing for you</em></span>
  </p>
  <p>
      because he doesn’t know how to go down on his knees<br> 
      & scarabs bleed green so as not to lose their way in his hands. breath<br> 
      catches on <span><em>i, unholy</em></span>
  </p>
  <p>
      word not yet wrought in pain yet not uninherited. organs<br> 
      swell in the ocean, crack up on the rocks into a choir of feathers,<br>
      good for nothing angels in apogee,
  </p>
  <p>
      clouds chlorinated toxic enough for drink, the good lord stomps in yellow<br>
      galoshes because no one is looking<br>
      (he knew he should have had
  </p>
  <p>
      a throne but the thought of sitting on someone’s<br>
      shoulders made him want to<br>
      cry). he tried kissing his own creation like it was a
  </p>
  <p>
      mother because he never even had a mother,<br>
      but it was like looking back into your eyeball<br>
      or licking the tip of your elbow 
  </p>
  <p>
      with no one to tell the time<br>
      in the summer before before, before<br>
      after, before <span><em>stay</em></span>. 
  </p>
