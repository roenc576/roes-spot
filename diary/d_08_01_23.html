      I'm having problems with jealousy. It's nothing new, I feel all sorts of jealousy--of friends, of lovers, of family--but the most persistent and droning jealousy is that of artists. Poets, especially. And it's getting harder to stamp out. Maybe that's the problem though. The more I try to resist it the more I avoid other artists and the more I avoid actually making art of my own.

      On a related note, I'm thinking of coding a program that takes poems I haven't read by established poets, dead poets, twitter mutual poets, and completely anonymizes them. The issue is that when I see a poem published by a magazine that I want to submit to, no matter its quality, I seethe. And it distracts from me being able to actually read the poem D: It's not fun it really isn't, it's a disease.
