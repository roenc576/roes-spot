I don't think I've laughed out loud this much while reading a book in years. I swear every two pages a laugh is startled out of me. I love all the characters deeply and I'm only like forty pages in. I relate to Benson so much. His struggles with avoidance and the kind of tension that exists between so many of these characters makes me want to read everything he's written.
